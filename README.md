This repository is a collection of notebooks originally created by Dr. Ajit Kumar. I have used these notebooks as a foundation to learn, explore, and understand concepts in LLM and related domains.

Along the way, I have also added my own experiments, modifications, and extensions to the notebooks. These include trying out different approaches, testing variations of models, and implementing additional features to deepen my understanding.

The aim of this repository is to serve both as a record of my learning journey and as a resource for others who may want to study the concepts, explore the experiments, or build upon them further.
